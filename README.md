## Installation

1) Clone this repo

2) Install the required packages

3) Download the data using `chmod +x run.sh` and `./run.sh`

4) Process the data using `data_prep.py` and `scene_img_prep.py`

## Training

The network can be trained using the `train.py` script. 

```
python trainer.py --csv_train <path/to/train_annots.csv>  --csv_classes <path/to/train/class_list.csv>  --csv_val <path/to/val_annots.csv> --depth <resnet depth>
```

## Model

The retinanet model uses a resnet backbone. You can set the depth of the resnet model using the --depth argument. Depth must be one of 18, 34, 50, 101 or 152. Note that deeper models are more accurate but are slower and use more memory.

## CSV datasets
It uses two CSV files: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping.

### Annotations format
The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.
Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.
Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.
The expected format of each line is:
```
path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

Some images may not contain any labeled objects.
To add these images to the dataset as negative examples,
add an annotation where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `class_name` are all empty:
```
path/to/image.jpg,,,,,
```

A full example:
```
/data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat
/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,22,5,89,84,bird
/data/imgs/img_003.jpg,,,,,
```

This defines a dataset with 3 images.
`img_001.jpg` contains a cow.
`img_002.jpg` contains a cat and a bird.
`img_003.jpg` contains no interesting objects/animals.


### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
bird,2
```
